  The biggest thing I’d do is add proper performance metrics. This would allow Chloe to be satisfied with her bureaucratic approach, as all she would need to do is meet those metrics and feel content with the rules in place. Ben would have to put in extra effort to meet metrics that go beyond simply attending work every day, and his individualistic approach would hinder progress less. Additionally, if a performance metric is added for team effort, Sarah will also be satisfied since her extra effort in coaching and mentoring the team would be recognized in her evaluation. The second root cause I would identify is Maria, as she lacks key leadership qualities such as adaptability to new technology and the ability to manage time or work efficiently. Now as she has shown promise in her field and growth for the company, if she is given some workshopping and guidance then she may prove to be a great leader and that I believe is a risk worth taking.

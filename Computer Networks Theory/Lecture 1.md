# Data Communications:

- Simplex is when data is received/transferred only one of those permanently. Half-duplex is when data is received and transferred but not at the same time. Full-duplex is when data is received and transferred at the same time.

## The Five Components of Data Communication:

1. Message: Information/data to be communicated
2.  Sender
3. Receiver 
4. Transmission medium: Physical Path by which a message travels
5. Protocol: A set of rules that govern data communication

# Private vs. Public IPs:

- Private IP's. are purchased or given to organizations and are not readily accessible by the public. Public IP's are accessible by the public and it is the addressing the surface-internet uses.
- Internet is not accessed via a private network but rather the router takes the request from the private IP and gives it to the public IP, getting the result and then handing it back to the private IP.
